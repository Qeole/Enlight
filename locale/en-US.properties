addon_description = Syntax highlight for raw source code.

# Preferences
style_title         = Color theme
style_description   = Select the color theme you want to use for syntax highlighting.
autohl_title        = Auto-highlight source code files
autohl_description  = Automatically apply highlighting to pages detected as source code (technically, detection occurs when HTML body contains a single child of name <pre></pre>). Needs deactivating then reactivating the add-on.
invert_title        = Alternate icon set
invert_description  = Use white (instead of dark gray) icons for the button, for a better contrast on dark themes. Needs deactivating then reactivating the add-on.
bgColor_title       = Adapt body background color
bgColor_description = Make HTML body background color the same as background color for the code block. Should remove white border around highlighted code. Disable if you use the add-on on web pages other than plain text source code files.
