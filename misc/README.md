Miscellaneous directory
=======================

Content under this directory is not part of the add-on itself.
It's a collection of scripts (or maybe it would be more exact to call them long commands), of graphical files used to generate the icons, and so on.
They're in the repo for backup, and someone might want to edit _e.g._ the `.svg` version of the icons, but none of it is needed to use or even compile the add-on.
